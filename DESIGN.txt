Overall the refactoring of the project was straightforward for most of the methods.

However there are few functions that I am unsure of:
- getNumFromRange in Entity -> made non static since it is only used in the class itself
- nearestEntity in Entity -> made static because it does not seem to use the instance vars of the class
- clamp in WorldView -> made non static since it is only used in the WorldView class
